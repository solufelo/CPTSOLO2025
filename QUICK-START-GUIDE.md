## 💰 Your Pricing (What to Charge)

### START HERE (First 3-5 Clients):
- Landing Page: **$400-600**
- Business Website: **$800-1,500**
- Video Content: **$500-900**
- Website + Video Combo: **$1,500-2,500** ⭐ (PUSH THIS!)

### Don't Go Lower Than:
- $300 for web-only projects
- $800 for video + web combo

### Why These Prices Work:
- Not too cheap (avoids bad clients)
- Not too high (easier to get first clients)
- Room to grow (increase 20-30% every 3-5 projects)
- Combo positioned as best value

---

## 🎯 How to Position Yourself

### Your Unique Advantage:
> "Most web developers can't shoot your content.  
> Most videographers can't build your site.  
> I do both — and it's why my clients get 3x better results."

### When Client Wants Just Web:
"I can definitely do that. But here's the thing — sites with professional video content convert 3x better. For just $X more, I can shoot your content while building your site. Most clients say the video was the best investment."

### When Client Wants Just Video:
"Absolutely! Quick question though — where will you showcase it? I build websites too, and we can knock both out in one project. It's actually cheaper to do together, and you'll have everything ready at once."

## 📊 Test Your Understanding

### Quiz Yourself:
1. Where is your pricing data stored? (`src/constants/index.js`)
2. Which component handles form submissions? (`ContactForm.jsx`)
3. What service sends emails from your form? (EmailJS)
4. What's your most profitable package? (Website + Video Combo)
5. Where do you host your site? (Netlify)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Pricing section"
- Make sure dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page

### "Contact form not sending emails"
- That's normal! You need to set up EmailJS first
- See `EMAILJS-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- Until then, it runs in "demo mode" (check console)

### "Pricing carousel not scrolling"
- Try scrolling horizontally (left/right)
- On mobile, swipe
- On desktop, click and drag
