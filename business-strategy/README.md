## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start Before You're Ready
- Don't wait for perfect logo, perfect website, perfect anything
- Launch with "good enough" and iterate
- Your first clients won't care about polish—they care about results

### 2. Niche Down Early
- Pick ONE industry to start (real estate is easiest)
- Master that vertical before expanding
- Specialized positioning = higher prices

### 3. Over-Deliver on First Clients
- First 3 clients get white-glove treatment
- Fast turnarounds, extra angles, surprise bonuses
- They become your referral engine

### 4. Track Everything
- Can't improve what you don't measure
- 5 mins/day updating spreadsheet = game changer
- Review weekly to spot patterns

### 5. Productize Ruthlessly
- Create shot list templates
- Build editing presets
- Systemize everything repeatable
- Frees you to scale

### 6. Price for Value, Not Time
- Don't think "hourly rate"
- Think "what's this worth to the client?"
- Real estate listing video that gets offer = $$$

### 7. Build Partnerships, Not Transactions
- Monthly retainers > one-off projects
- Recurring revenue = predictability
- Long-term clients = easier business

## 🚧 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Pricing Too Low**
- Don't compete on price
- You're selling results, not time
- $500/month minimum for retainers

**2. Taking on Wrong Clients**
- Say no to:
  - One-off projects when you want retainers
  - Clients who want tons of revisions
  - People shopping for cheapest option
  - Projects outside your niche (early on)

**3. Scope Creep**
- Define deliverables clearly
- Stick to agreement
- Additional requests = additional fees

**4. Not Tracking Time**
- You'll under-price if you don't know costs
- Track hours for first 10 projects
- Adjust pricing based on data

**5. Skipping Contracts**
- Always use written agreement
- Protects both parties
- Sets clear expectations

**6. Neglecting Marketing**
- Even with clients, keep prospecting
- Clients churn—need pipeline
- Target 10-20% outreach time always

**7. Doing Everything Yourself Too Long**
- Bring in help at $2-3K MRR
- Your time best spent on sales + strategy
- Editing can be outsourced
