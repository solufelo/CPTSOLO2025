**Time Investment:** 20-30 hours/month (all you)  
**Key Metric:** Deliver on time, over-deliver on quality

### Tier 2: Leverage ($2,500-4,000/month)
**Goal:** Multiply yourself, bring in contractor support

**Client Mix:**
- 3-4 retainer clients @ $600-1,000 each

**Time Investment:** 30-40 hours/month  
**Key Metric:** Client retention rate (aim for 80%+)

### Tier 3: Scale ($5,000-10,000/month)
**Goal:** Systems, templates, predictable delivery

**Client Mix:**
- 5-7 retainer clients @ $800-1,500 each

## üéØ Client Acquisition Formula - The Anchor Client Method

### Week 1: Find Your Anchor
**Niche:** Start with Real Estate (easiest to close, highest volume)

**Target Profile:**
- Active real estate agents in Waterloo/Brampton/Mississauga
- 5-20 listings per year (not too small, not unreachable)
- Active on Instagram (values content)
- Amateur-looking current content (obvious improvement opportunity)

**Research:**
- Check local brokerages: Royal LePage, RE/MAX, Keller Williams
- Instagram hashtags: #WaterlooRealEstate #BramptonHomes #MississaugaRealtor
- Find 5 specific agents who fit the profile

### Week 2: Spec Reel That Sells
**Don't ask for work‚Äîshow them what they're missing**

**Action Steps:**
1. Shoot 1 property for free (friend's house, Airbnb, model home open house)
2. Edit it like a luxury listing (gimbal shots, drone, music, graphics)
3. Post on Instagram: "New Project: Waterloo Real Estate Content"
4. Tag the location, use local hashtags

**The Outreach (DM Script):**
```
Hey [Name]! 

Saw your [specific recent listing] in [Area]‚Äîlove the [specific compliment about property].

Just shot this spec reel for local properties (see my recent post). Thought you might like the style.

Would you be open to a trial shoot for your next listing? No charge, just want to build my real estate portfolio in the area.

If it turns out great, we can chat about ongoing content.

- Solomon
```

**Why this works:**
- You've already proven you can deliver
- Zero risk for them (free trial)
- Specific compliment shows you did research
- You're building local presence, not cold selling

### Week 3: Convert + Multiply
**The Leverage Play**

1. **Close 1 agent** at $400-500/month (2-3 listings/month)
2. **Over-deliver** on first listing (24-hour turnaround, extra angles, surprise drone shot)
3. **Ask for testimonial** (record a quick 30-second video on your phone)
4. **Request intro** to 2-3 colleagues at their brokerage

**The Ask (After Successful Delivery):**
```
Hey [Name], so glad you loved the video! Quick favor:

I'm building out my real estate portfolio in [Area]. Do you know 2-3 other agents at [Brokerage] who might benefit from this style of content?

Happy to offer them the same trial deal. 

Plus, if anyone signs on, I'll give you a free listing video as a thank you!
```

**Why this works:** Real estate agents are networked. One happy client = 3-5 potential referrals.

## ü§ù Contractor Management

### When to Bring in Help
**Signals you need a contractor:**
- You have 3+ retainer clients
- You're spending 15+ hours/week just editing
- You're turning down work because you're at capacity
- You want to take a weekend off without missing deadlines

### Your Buddy as Contractor
**Clear structure prevents friendship problems:**

**Role Definition:**
- You: Client relationships, filming, creative direction, final approval
- Him: Editing, b-roll capture, color grading, revisions

**Compensation Models (Pick One):**

**Option A: Per-Project Rate**
- Simple social video edit: $75-100
- Real estate listing edit: $100-150
- Event highlight reel: $150-250
- Testimonial interview: $100-150

**Option B: Hourly Rate**
- $20-25/hour for editing work
- Track hours in shared doc
- Weekly or bi-weekly payment

**Option C: Revenue Share**
- 30% of project revenue for work he completes
- Example: $600 retainer client, he edits all videos = $180/month
- Aligns incentives, scales with your growth

**My Recommendation:** Start with Option A (per-project), move to Option C (revenue share) once you have consistent MRR.
