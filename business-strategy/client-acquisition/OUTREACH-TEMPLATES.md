Hey [Name]! 

Saw your [specific recent listing] in [Area]—love the [specific detail about the property, e.g., "open concept kitchen" or "backyard space"].

Would you be open to a trial shoot for your next listing? No charge—just building my real estate portfolio in the area.

If it turns out great, we can chat about ongoing content for future listings.

Let me know!

### After Successful Trial Shoot

```
Hey [Name]!

So glad you loved the video! Quick question:

Do you know 2-3 other agents at [Brokerage Name] who might want this style of content for their listings?

I'm building out my real estate portfolio in [Area] and offering the same trial deal to a few more agents.

Plus—if anyone you refer signs on for monthly content, I'll give you a free listing video as a thank you! 🎁

Let me know if anyone comes to mind.

## 🍔 Restaurant/Cafe Outreach

### Cold Email (Found via Instagram/Google)

```
Subject: Quick content idea for [Restaurant Name]

Hey [Owner/Manager Name],

I'm Solomon, a content creator based in Brampton. I've been following [Restaurant Name] on Instagram and love [specific dish/vibe/recent post].

I noticed you're posting regularly, which is awesome—but I think you could 10x engagement with short-form video content (Reels/TikToks).

Here's what I'm thinking:

📹 8-10 menu item videos per month
🎬 Fast-paced, mouth-watering edits
📱 Optimized for Instagram Reels & TikTok
💰 $800-1,200/month (way cheaper than hiring full-time)

I'd love to shoot 1-2 sample videos for you (on the house) so you can see the style. If you like them, we can set up a monthly retainer.

Available this week or next for a quick shoot. Let me know!

## 🚀 Pro Tips for Outreach

**1. Personalization is Non-Negotiable**
- Never copy/paste without customizing
- Reference specific recent posts, projects, or details
- Shows you did research

**2. Lead with Value, Not Your Resume**
- They don't care about your 6 years of experience (yet)
- They care about solving their problem
- Offer free trials, samples, or insights

**3. Follow Up Strategically**
- Day 3: Gentle bump
- Day 7: Final offer
- Don't be annoying

**4. Track Everything**
- Use a simple spreadsheet to track:
  - Who you contacted
  - When you contacted them
  - Their response (if any)
  - Follow-up dates
  - Conversion status

**5. Test and Iterate**
- Try different subject lines
- Test DM vs email
- A/B test your offers
- Double down on what works
