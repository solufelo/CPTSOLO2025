# üìä Client Tracking System

**Simple Spreadsheet Setup for Managing Outreach, Clients, and Revenue**

---

## üéØ Why Track Everything?

Without tracking, you're flying blind:
- Can't see which outreach methods work
- Don't know your conversion rates
- Lose track of follow-ups
- Miss revenue opportunities

**With tracking, you know:**
- Which niches convert best
- Your average deal size
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Where to focus your time

---

## üìÅ Spreadsheet Structure

### Create 4 Tabs in Google Sheets:

1. **Lead Pipeline** - Track outreach and prospects
2. **Active Clients** - Manage current retainers and projects
3. **Revenue Tracker** - Monthly income and projections
4. **Project Deliverables** - Track what's due and delivered
