## 🎨 How to Update Prices (Every Quarter)

Open `src/constants/index.js` and find `pricingPackages`:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Landing Page",
  priceRange: "$400 - $600", // ← Change this
  // ... rest stays the same
}
```

**Recommended price increases:**
- After 3 clients: +$100-200 per package
- After 6 clients: +$200-300 per package
- After 10 clients: +$500-1,000 per package

## 💡 Pricing Psychology Tips

### What's Working in Your Favor:
1. **Combo package has "Most Popular" badge** → clients gravitate toward it
2. **Price ranges show flexibility** → "Starting at $X" makes you seem negotiable
3. **Features list shows value** → clients see what they're getting
4. **Turnaround times build trust** → clear expectations

### Test These Strategies:
- **First 3 clients:** Offer 20% discount for testimonial + portfolio piece
- **Combo package:** Push this hard - it's your unique value (video + web)
- **Budget "Not sure yet":** Great for filtering serious vs. window shoppers

## 🎯 Sales Positioning

### Your Unique Selling Point:
> "Most web developers can't shoot your content. Most videographers can't build your site. I do both."

### When a Client Asks for Just Web:
"I can do that, but honestly, the combo package gets 3x better results. You'll have professional content to fill your site immediately, and it's only $X more."

### When a Client Asks for Just Video:
"Absolutely. But where will you showcase it? A website costs $X, and I can build it while I'm shooting your content. Most clients save 2-3 weeks doing it together."

---

## 📊 Tracking Your Progress

### What to Track:
1. **Form submissions** (EmailJS dashboard after setup)
2. **Which packages get inquiries** (adjust pricing based on demand)
3. **Conversion rate** (inquiries → actual clients)

### Monthly Review:
- **Month 1-3:** Keep prices stable, collect testimonials
- **Month 4:** Raise prices if you're booking too fast
- **Month 6:** Combo package should be $2,000-3,000 minimum

---

```bash
npm run dev
```
1. Navigate to Pricing section → scroll through packages
2. Navigate to Contact section → fill out the form

## 📝 About Namecheap vs Netlify

**You mentioned Namecheap hosting**, but your site is actually on **Netlify** (better choice!):

| Feature | Namecheap | Netlify (What you have) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Speed | Slower (traditional hosting) | ⚡ Lightning fast (CDN) |
| Bandwidth | 20GB limit | ♾️ Unlimited for static sites |
| Deploys | Manual FTP uploads | 🚀 Git push = auto deploy |
| SSL | Manual setup | ✅ Auto SSL |
| Cost | ~$3-10/month | 🆓 FREE |

**Recommendation:** Keep using Netlify for your React sites. Use Namecheap only for:
- Domain name registration ($12/year)
- Email hosting (if they offer it)
