## üìû FINAL NOTES

I specialize in helping restaurants, artists, and startups build their complete digital presence‚Äîthe platform AND the content."

### When Someone Asks "So You Do Both?":
> "Exactly. I started as a videographer 6 years ago, but kept seeing great content die on terrible websites. So I learned to code. Now I can build the platform AND create the content‚Äîwhich means everything works together perfectly instead of being pieced together by different people who never talk to each other."
