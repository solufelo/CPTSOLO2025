## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you handle both the website and the video content?
Yes! That's exactly what makes my service unique. I build the website AND create the content to fill it. No coordination between separate vendors—everything works together seamlessly.

- Video content: 48 hours (standard), 24 hours (rush)
- Website development: 2-6 weeks depending on complexity

Absolutely. Web development is fully remote—I work with clients anywhere. For video production, I primarily serve Waterloo, Brampton, Kitchener, and the GTA, but can travel for the right project.

### What's included in an integrated package?
Complete digital presence: website + content + strategy. For example, a restaurant package includes website development, menu photography, and social media video content—all working together as one cohesive brand experience.

### How much do your services cost?

## 📞 REMEMBER YOUR PITCH

### When Someone Asks What You Do:

### When Someone Asks About Your Background:
> "Started as a videographer 6 years ago—1,400 projects with a 4.8-star rating. Learned to code because I kept seeing great content on terrible websites. Now I'm finishing my Computer Science degree at Laurier while working as their official videographer, and I help businesses with complete digital solutions—the platform AND the content."

### When Someone Asks About 3D/Motion:
> "I use Three.js to add 3D elements to websites—product viewers, interactive experiences, animated scenes. For video work, I do motion graphics in After Effects and 3D renders in Blender. It's about making both web and video more engaging and interactive."
