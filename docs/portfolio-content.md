## 👤 ABOUT SECTION CONTENT

### The Story (Choose tone based on design)

**Version 1: Professional & Direct**
```
I'm Solomon Olufelo — a Computer Science student at Wilfrid Laurier University who's spent the last 6 years turning ideas into visual stories and the last 2 years building them into digital experiences.

What started as freelance videography (1,400+ projects, 4.8★ rating) evolved into a passion for full-stack development when I realized the best content needs great platforms to live on.

Now I bridge both worlds: I understand what makes content perform AND how to build the systems that scale it.
```

**Version 2: Story-Driven**
```
Six years ago, I picked up a camera and started capturing stories for local businesses, artists, and athletes. 1,400 projects later with a 4.8-star rating, I realized something:

Great content dies on bad platforms.

So I learned to code. React, Next.js, Node, Python, databases — I built the technical foundation to match my creative experience.

Now I do both: create the content that converts attention into customers AND build the platforms that scale results.
```

**Version 3: Results-Focused**
```
Computer Science student. 6-year videographer. Full-stack developer.

The numbers: 1,400+ completed projects. 4.8/5.0 stars across 700+ reviews. $30K+ in client revenue. 99% on-time delivery. Bronze & Silver athletic videography awards.

The reality: I combine technical precision with creative storytelling. I build web applications that perform and create content that converts.

Currently: WLU videographer, freelance developer, building businesses that live at the intersection of tech and creativity.
