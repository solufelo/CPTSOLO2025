## üí° Best Practices

### Always Get a Deposit
- **Minimum:** 50% upfront
- **Better:** 50% to start, 50% upon completion
- **Best:** 1/3 to start, 1/3 at midpoint, 1/3 at completion (for larger projects)

### Why Deposits Matter:
- Filters out non-serious clients
- Covers your time if they cancel
- Proves they have budget
- Makes them committed to the project

### Payment Workflow:
```
1. Free consultation (no payment)
2. Send proposal/contract via email
3. Send Stripe payment link for deposit
4. Wait for payment to clear (instant with Stripe)
5. Begin work ONLY after deposit received
6. Send invoice for remaining balance upon completion
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### "Should I offer payment plans?"
For projects over $2,000, consider 3 payments: 33% to start, 33% at midpoint, 33% at completion.

### "What if they want to pay with PayPal/Interac?"
Stripe is better (instant, no fees for you), but if client insists, you can accept alternative payments. Just make sure you get deposit first.

### "How do I handle scope creep?"
In your contract, clearly define what's included. Extra work = extra charges. Send updated invoice via Stripe.

### "When should I use test mode vs live mode?"
Test mode = practice, fake money. Live mode = real transactions. Switch to live after testing everything.
