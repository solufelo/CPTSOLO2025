## 🎨 Design Decisions (Why It Looks This Way)

### Color Psychology:
- **Black background** → Premium, professional, sophisticated
- **Gold accents** → Luxury, success, quality
- **White text** → High contrast, easy to read
- **Green "Available"** → Urgency, act now

### Layout Psychology:
- **3 packages** → Not overwhelming (Goldilocks principle)
- **Combo in center** → Natural eye focus
- **Slightly larger** → Hero package stands out
- **Gold glow** → Subconscious attention

### Copy Psychology:
- **"Most Popular"** → Social proof (everyone's choosing this)
- **"15% discount"** → Urgency (limited time)
- **"First 3 clients"** → Scarcity (act fast)
- **"No contracts"** → Removes friction (less commitment fear)
- **"Unlimited revisions"** → Removes risk (you'll be happy)

## 🚀 Marketing Strategy

### Where to Share:
1. **Instagram Story** - Tag @caaptainsolo, use link sticker
2. **LinkedIn Post** - "Just launched my new portfolio..."
3. **BrandLabs Application** - Use as portfolio link
4. **Funded Entertainment** - Show video + web combo ability
5. **Local Business Groups** - GTA Facebook groups, Reddit r/TorontoBusiness

### What to Say:
> "Just launched Captain Solo — I build websites AND create the video content to fill them. 
> 
> Most agencies charge you twice (one for web, one for video). I do both, so you get:
> ✅ Cohesive brand experience
> ✅ Faster delivery (one point of contact)
> ✅ Better results (integrated strategy)
> 
> First 3 clients get 15% off. Who's building something cool? 🚀"
